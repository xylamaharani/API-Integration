Flight Application is an application build by integrating API from RapidAPI website.
We use 4 kind of API including:
- https://rapidapi.com/haxednet/api/chatgpt-api8
- https://rapidapi.com/karanp41-eRiF1pYLK1P/api/world-airports-directory
- https://rapidapi.com/farish978/api/flight-fare-search
- https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange/

To use the code, you need to subscribe first to 4 of the used API on the RapidAPI website.
Notable, you only have 10 limit request, so use it wisely and effectively to develop the code.
